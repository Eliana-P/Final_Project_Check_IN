Level 2 Narration
Pain suddenly erupts in the back of your head, before your vision turns black.
When you awaken you note that you are in a different room.
Taking in your surroundings, it appears that you are inside of a large, run down gymnasium.
You sway slightly as you try to stand.
Your eyes scan the room, falling on a pair of double doors.
Before you can rejoice in finding a potential exit, you notice a large figure blocking the doors.
It seems to have the body of a man and the head of a pig. Blood runs from empty sockets that should be filled with eyes.
You can only stare in horror as the creature raises the large knife in its hand before letting out a horrible scream and rushing towards you.
