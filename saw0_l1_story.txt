Level 1 Narration (Short)
You take in your surroundings, unable to remember how you arrived here.
Next to you, is another person who also seems to be regaining consciousness. 
Suddenly, audio begins to emit from a tape recorder at your feet.
Hello. You must be wondering where you are. But I would not focus on such trivial details.
Remember this: only one of you will survive today. Or perhaps you will both die.
Regardless, only one of you can move forward.
So turn on each other, and fight for your right to live. 
Welcome to your reawakening.
